# Input Specifications

All submitted imaging data must comply with the input specifications detailed below. Any datasets that fail to meet these requirements will be deemed unsuitable for processing and rejected.

**The required MRI sequence is a diffusion-weighted, single-shot spin echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisition with whole-brain coverage.**

| Parameter                | Value        |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Field strength, T        | 3            |
| Repetition time (TR), ms | 6000 – 17000 |
| Echo time (TE), ms       | 55 – 100     |
| In-plane resolution, mm² | 1.85 – 2.15  |
| Slice thickness, mm      | 2            |
| Slices, n                | 64 – 86      |
| Slice acquisition        | Interleaved  |
| Slice gap, mm            | 0            |
| Flip angle, degrees      | 90           |
