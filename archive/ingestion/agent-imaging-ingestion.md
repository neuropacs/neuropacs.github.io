- **Intelligent Quality Control**: Automated validation ensures only properly formatted studies proceed to analysis
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Monitor study ingestion progress from unstable to processing-ready
- **Secure Data Handling**: Built-in de-identification and encryption protect patient data
- **Healthcare Compliant**: Full compliance with healthcare regulations and DICOM standards

## Getting Started

1. **PACS Integration**  
   Configure the Agent as a DICOM destination in your PACS system.

## PACS Integration

The Agent operates as a standard DICOM destination within your imaging environment. Once configured, your PACS can send images directly to the Agent using routing rules, eliminating manual intervention.

### Setting Up as a DICOM Destination

**Configuration Requirements:**

- Unique AE Title for the Agent
- Network port assignment (typically 104 or custom)
- IP address or hostname accessibility
- DICOM protocol compatibility verification

### Configuring Routing Rules

Routing rules determine which studies are automatically sent to the Agent for processing.

**Common Routing Scenarios:**

- **Modality-based**: Route all MRI or CT studies
- **Study Type**: Target specific protocols (e.g., diffusion-weighted brain MRIs)
- **Scanner-specific**: Route studies from particular imaging equipment
- **Time-based**: Send studies during specific hours
- **Anatomical Region**: Focus on brain, spine, or other body regions

**Example Routing Rule Configuration:**

```
Modality: MR
Body Part: BRAIN
Protocol: *DIFFUSION*
Destination: NEUROPACS_AGENT
```

## Study Management

### Studies Page Overview

The Studies page serves as the central hub for monitoring all imaging studies received by the Agent from connected PACS systems.

![Studies Page Overview](/img/agent_studies_page.png)

### Study Status Workflow

**Study Progression:**

1. **Receiving**: Initial DICOM transfer in progress
2. **Unstable**: Images arriving but dataset incomplete
3. **Stable**: All required images received and verified
4. **QC Passed**: Quality control validation successful
5. **Uploading**: Study currently being uploaded to cloud
6. **Pending**: Study is uploaded and awaiting cloud processing
7. **Processing**: Study is currently undergoing analysis
8. **Failed**: An error occured during processing.
9. **Delivered**: Report generated and available for review

**Status Indicators:**

- **Unstable** (Yellow): Images are arriving but the dataset is incomplete
- **Stable** (Blue): All required images received and verified, ready for quality control
- **QC Passed** (Green): Quality control validation successful, ready for cloud processing
- **Processing** (Orange): Study uploaded to Neuropacs Cloud for analysis
- **Failed** (Red): Quality control or processing errors occurred

### Study Information Display

Each study entry shows:

- **Patient ID**: De-identified patient identifier
- **Study Date/Time**: When the imaging was performed
- **Modality**: Imaging type (MR, CT, etc.)
- **Series Count**: Number of image series received
- **Study Description**: Protocol or study type
- **Status**: Current processing stage
- **Actions**: Available operations (QC review, retry, etc.)

## Quality Control System

### Automated Quality Control

After a study reaches stable status, the Agent automatically generates a Quality Control Report to verify the study meets processing requirements before cloud upload.

**QC Validation Checks:**

- Image format and integrity verification
- Required sequences presence validation
- Metadata completeness assessment
- Image quality metrics evaluation
- Protocol compliance verification

### Accessing QC Reports

**Reviewing Quality Control Results:**

1. Navigate to the Studies page
2. Locate the study with QC status
3. Select the **QC** button in the Actions column
4. Review the automated quality assessment

### QC Report Features

**Report Components:**

- **Executive Summary**: Overall pass/fail status with score
- **Parameter Testing**: Individual test results for each validation criterion
- **Image Analysis**: Technical quality metrics and measurements
- **Metadata Review**: DICOM header validation results
- **Recommendations**: Suggested actions for failed studies

**QC Parameters Evaluated:**

- Image resolution and dimensions
- Slice thickness and spacing
- Contrast and signal-to-noise ratio
- Motion artifacts detection
- Sequence parameter validation
